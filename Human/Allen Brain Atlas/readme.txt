The Allen Human Brain Atlas is a comprehensive map of gene expression and anatomy. In this project, we utilize this data to:

Identify high-density neural regions associated with conscious processing.

Correlate gene expression signatures with brain regions involved in the "Global Workspace."

Provide a standardized coordinate system for measuring consciousness-related metrics.

📂 Contents
Analysis_Scripts/: Python scripts for querying the Allen API and downloading microarray data.

Mapping/: Tools to map custom datasets onto the Allen 3D coordinate space.

Examples/: Notebooks showing how to visualize consciousness metrics across specific brain structures.

🛠 Installation & Setup
To use these scripts, you will need the Allen Software Development Kit (SDK):

Bash

pip install allensdk
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
🚀 How to Use
Data Fetching: Use the scripts provided to pull expression data for specific regions of interest (ROI).

Normalization: Run the normalization scripts to prepare the data for comparison with EEG or fMRI datasets.

Visualization: Generate heatmaps of the human brain to see where consciousness-related activity is most likely to be localized.
