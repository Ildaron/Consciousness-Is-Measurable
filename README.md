#Consciousness Is Measurable

This repository treats consciousness as an engineering problem, not a mystical one.

Most research avoids defining consciousness because definitions invite failure. This repo does the opposite.

If consciousness exists, it leaves data traces. If it leaves data traces, it can be measured, benchmarked, and compared.

This project exists to collect, structure, and benchmark those traces.
