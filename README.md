# Consciousness Is Measurable

This repository treats consciousness as an engineering problem, not a mystical one.

Most research avoids defining consciousness because definitions invite failure. This repo does the opposite.

If consciousness exists, it leaves data traces. If it leaves data traces, it can be measured, benchmarked, and compared.

This project exists to collect, structure, and benchmark those traces.


### What This Repo Actually Contains
1. Curated Datasets (Human, Animal, Machine)

This repo does not dump links. It organizes them.  
Human / Biological  
- EEG datasets (awake, asleep, anesthetized)
- fMRI awareness and masking experiments
- Connectome-level structural data
Cognitive / Behavioral Proxies
- Reaction time and attention-switching tasks
- Metacognition confidence datasets
- Error-awareness experiments
Machine / Synthetic
- LLM self-reflection traces
- Long-horizon agent memory logs
- Identity consistency across context resets
- Tool-use self-modeling outputs
Each dataset includes:

Why it relates to consciousness
- What proxy it measures
- Known limitations
- My plan to create the next format
